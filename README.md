# Chess Variant Game (Python)
A simplified command-line chess variant built from scratch in Python

In May 2025, I decided to revisit and upgrade this project, originally written in November 2023, to better reflect my current skill level. Planned improvements include modularizing the game logic, implementing the full ruleset, and converting the interface from command-line to a graphical version using Pygame.

## The current version features:

    A playable chess variant where the goal is to capture all of one piece type (e.g. all knights or all pawns).

    Classic chess movements for all pieces, with simplified rules (no check/checkmate, no castling, en passant, or promotion).

    A fully functional board system, piece movement validation, and win condition tracking.

    Clean separation between game logic (game.py), base piece behavior (piece.py), and individual piece rules (subpieces.py).

This project emphasizes fundamental OOP principles (inheritance, encapsulation), board manipulation, and rule validation in a turn-based game context.

Stay tuned for the GUI upgrade and final rule implementation!
